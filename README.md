# 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a realistic enterprise Active Directory environment (**EvilCorp.local**) containing multiple workstations, servers, users, organizational units, and services.

The objective is to understand how attackers compromise Windows domains by abusing authentication protocols, Active Directory misconfigurations, credential attacks, and lateral movement techniques.

Each attack includes:

- Attack overview
- Prerequisites
- Internal protocol explanation
- Step-by-step execution
- Screenshots

---

# 🖥️ Lab Infrastructure

The environment consists of:

- Domain Controller
- IIS Web Server
- HR Workstation
- IT Workstation
- Management Workstation
- Hacker Machine (Kali Linux)

# 🔐 Kerberos Authentication Workflow

Understanding the Kerberos authentication process is essential before exploring the attacks.

The following diagram illustrates the complete Kerberos authentication workflow,and the tickets exchange between the client and the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

# 🛡️ MITRE ATT&CK Coverage & Mitigation

This project covers techniques across multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including:

- Initial Access
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion

Also highlights the primary defensive measures for each attack. The following matrix summarizes the recommended mitigations that help reduce the risk of compromise in an Active Directory environment.
